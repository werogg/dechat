# DeChat: A Decentralized and Highly Encrypted P2P Chat over Tor

DeChat is a decentralized and highly secure peer-to-peer chat application that provides end-to-end encryption and anonymity for its users. The application uses Tor as the underlying network layer to ensure that all communications are routed through multiple relays, making it virtually impossible for anyone to trace the messages back to their origin.

DeChat is designed to be highly resilient and resistant to censorship. Since the application is decentralized, there is no central point of control or failure, making it virtually impossible for any entity to shut down the network or censor individual users.
